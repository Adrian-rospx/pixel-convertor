# Image Pixelating Convertor

Learning project: It turns pictures pixelated and adds
a black outline for transparent pictures.

I learned about the PIL library, image processing, pathlib
and project organisation

### Usage:

Place the images you want to convert in the Images directory  
Then run the main.py file from the src folder

Enter the name of the file (e.g. "dog.png")
and then the pixel size (how pixelated you want the image to be)

Tested with .jpg and .png

Doesn't work with high resolution vertical images
